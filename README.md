# HDest Voxels

[![Nightly Build](https://github.com/HDest-Community/HDest-Voxels/actions/workflows/nightly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HDest-Community/HDest-Voxels/actions/workflows/nightly.yml)

Voxels, for your hideous destruction.

### Note

Due to the way GZDoom loads Voxels/Models, the original sprite lumps need to be loaded in order for the voxels to replace them.  Because of this, simply downloading the repo as a ZIP will then require each addon to be loaded.  This can be circumvented by deleting the `VOXELDEF` or `MODELDEF` for the addons you choose not to run with (for example, If not running Peppergrinder, remove the `MODELDEF.peppergrinder` file from the root of the ZIP/repo to prevent GZDoom from attempting to load those voxels).

However, There is a nightly build of this project that already splits out the various voxels/models for Vanilla Doom/HDest, Peppergrinder, Radtech, and other future addon voxels into separate PK3s, as well as providing a "Full" PK3 for those that have all of the included addons and don't want to load multiple files.  You can grab the latest nightly build below:

Note, the requirement to have Cheello's Voxel Doom is no longer needed, as those voxel assets are included in this pack due to the above permission.

```
RadTechVoxelPack
A voxel plug-in for RadTech Weapons Pack

Adds voxel models for weapon and items
from the RadTech Weapons and Item Packs.

Doomed Shotgun and DM-97 Plasma Rifle need it to work.
