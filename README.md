### Radtech Items & Weapons Pickups

_Originally made by Swampyrad_

Note, the requirement to have Cheello's Voxel Doom is no longer needed, as those voxel assets are included in this pack due to the above permission.

Original Radtech Voxels Readme:

```
RadTechVoxelPack
A voxel plug-in for RadTech Weapons Pack

Adds voxel models for weapon and items
from the RadTech Weapons and Item Packs.

Requires Cheello's Voxel Doom mod, since the
Doomed Shotgun and DM-97 Plasma Rifle need it to work.
